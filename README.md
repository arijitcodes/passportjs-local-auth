`Stack` : NodeJS

`Technologies Used` : NodeJS, ExpressJS, Passport, Passport-Local, BCrypt, MongoDB, Mongoose, Http-Errors, Express-Sessions

`Functionalities & Description` : A Simple Node-Express based API. It was made as a demo implementation of PassportJS Local Authentication Strategy. ExpressJS was used to create the API. MongoDB was used as DB and Mongoose was used as ORM. BCrypt was used for password hashing. 'http-errors' module was used to throw API Errors along with error code - to handle the errors from Express error Handler.

## Note from the Developer:

This is just a demo implementation and not a final project. I made this to keep it as a reference for future and putting it in github in-case anyone finds it useful.
